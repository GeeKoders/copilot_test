# Context  
I have an is_valid_email function in email_utils.py that checks if an email address is valid.

# Instruction  
Write a Python test file named test_email.py using pytest to test the is_valid_email function.

# Constraints  
Include at least 3 valid email test cases and 3 invalid email test cases.  
Use clear and readable assertions.  
Assume email_utils.py is in the same directory.  
Include an edge case with sub-domain (e.g., user@mail.example.com).

# Persona  
Act as a senior Python developer writing beginner-friendly tests.

# Style  
Write clean, simple, and easy-to-read test code.
