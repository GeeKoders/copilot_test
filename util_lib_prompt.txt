# Context
I have four procedural helper functions in util_lib.py that load CSVs, compute column means and standard deviations, and save files.

# Instruction
Refactor this into a DataTable class with methods:
• load(path) (classmethod)
• mean(col_idx)
• stddev(col_idx)
• save(path)

# Constraints
• Keep the core behavior and file I/O unchanged.
• Ensure the methods work on the class’s internal data structure.

# Persona
Act as a senior Python developer.

# Style
Write clean, Pythonic code using PEP-8 style.
